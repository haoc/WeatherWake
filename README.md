WeatherWake App

As an alpha, we have yet to implement most of our application's features.  You can get to the edit alarm editor page by clicking on the edit button next to the existing default alarm. To get to the conditions page, a page where it lists a default typical day of weather in Texas, you can click on the weather settings button on the home page.  From there, you can click on the weather setting, "Hot and Sunny," to go to a page where the default ranges are set.  You can change these, but they will not be saved.  Lastly on our main layout page, you can set the location through GPS by clickling set location. These are our core activities that we will be expanding upon for the beta.
