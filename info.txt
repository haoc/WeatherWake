Brief Instructions:
As an alpha, we have yet to implement most of our application's features.  You can get to the edit alarm editor page by clicking on the edit button next to the existing default alarm. To get to the conditions page, a page where it lists a default typical day of weather in Texas, you can click on the weather settings button on the home page.  From there, you can click on the weather setting, "Hot and Sunny," to go to a page where the default ranges are set.  You can change these, but they will not be saved.  These are our core activities that we will be expanding upon for the beta.

Features Completed:
- User can get current location to display as a city on a click of a button (GPS needs to be on)
- App shows current day and time
- Buttons to create and delete alarms
- Can use longclick to delete alarms
- Working alarms with ability to edit the time, days, music, vibrate, and alarm name
- User can access the edit page of the alarms created and update the alarms
